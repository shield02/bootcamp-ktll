# WHAT WE WILL LEARN
# How to write and run a unit test using pytest
# How to use assert to validate code logic

# NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR A TEST FILE
# 1. test_anyname_that_you_like.py
# 2. anyname_that_you_like_test.py
# The directory is usually called "test"

# FIXTURES
# Fixtures are used to initialize test functions. They
# provide a fixed baseline so that tests execute reliably
# and produce consistent , repeatedable results. They are
# accessed by test functions as arguement.

# A fixture is typically a normal Python function.
# To create a fixture, we use a decorator @pytest.fixture
# annotation. Then we use that function as an arguement in
# our test.
