# Welcome To The AIRBNB Clone Project

This will be an intensive project towards building your first full web application.

## TASK 1

* Write a class called BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes \
    Store it in models/base_model.py. That is, you will create a directory models inside projects then \
    create the file base_model.py inside models. \
* The Public Instance Attributes for BaseModel: \
    id: (string) assigned using uuid.uuid4() when an instance is created \
        we use uuid.uuid4() because we want to have unique id for each BaseModel, don't forget to convert to string  \
    created_at: (datetime) will have the value of the current datetime when an instance is created \
    updated_at: (datetime) will have the value of the current datetime when an instance is created and \
                it will be updated every time you change your object \
* Add a method `__str__`: that should print this format, `[<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>` \
`__str__` is a special method that is used to print the unofficial representation of a class
`__repr__` is a special method that prints the official representation of a class
* Public Instance Methods:
    save(self): updates the public instance attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
    to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of `__dict__` of the instance:
        by using `self.__dict__`, only instance attributes set will be returned
        a key `__class__` must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
        `created_at` and `updated_at` must be converted to string object in ISO format
            the format for the date %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (exp: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
            you can use isoformat() of datetime object
        this method will create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel

## TASK 2

Update `__init__()` constructor method of the `models/base_model.py` file.

* `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):`
    * `*args` will not be used
    * if `**kwargs` is not empty:
        * each key of the kwargs dictionary is an attribute name
        * each value of the kwargs dictionary is the value of this attribute name
        * ensure you convert `created_at` and `updated_at` from string to datetime object
    * otherwise:
        * create `id` and `created_at` as you did previously for every new instance

## TASK 3

Write a class `FileStorage` that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances:

* create a new file `models/engine/file_storage.py`
* Private class attributes:
    * __file_path: (string) - path to the JSON file
    * __objects: (dictionary) - empty but will store all objects by `<class name>.id` (ex: to store a `BaseModel` object with `id=12121212`, the key will be `BaseModel.12121212`)
* Public instance methods:
    * `all(self, cls=None)`: returns the dictionary `__objects` ie. Retrieves all the instances stored in the `__objects` dictionary
    * `new(self, obj)`: sets in `__objects` the obj with key `<obj class name>.id`. Inserts a new object to my list of objects stored. `obj` is the object to be inserted into the `__object` dictionary
    * `save(self)`: serializes `__objects` to the JSON file `(path: __file_path)`. Or you can understand it as saving the objects to a file by converting the `__object` dictionary
        object to a JSON string.
    * `reload(self)`: deserializes the JSON file to `__objects` (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing. If the file doesn’t exist, no exception should be raised)
