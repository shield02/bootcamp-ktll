# Remember you are to do your solutions in the solutions folder
# Create a file with the exact same file name
# You can copy the questions from here down there
# But don't type anything inside this file
# NOTE: Make sure you call all your functions with at least two
        # examples to show how your function works.

"""
# Question #1
------------------------------------------------------------------
Research 10 methods used with tuples in python and show at least
two examples of each of the methods.
"""

"""
# Question #2
------------------------------------------------------------------
Research 10 methods used with sets in python show at least
two examples of each of the methods.
"""

"""
# Question #3
------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns only the
uniques numbers in the list.
"""

"""
# Question #4
------------------------------------------------------------------
Return the value 20 from the tuple below:
tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

N/B: you do not need to write a function for this question
"""

"""
# Question #5
------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpacking of values in a tuple.
If a tuple has 4 values, it can be unpacked by declearing four
variables and assigning the tuple to it.

Unpack the values of the tuple into 4 variables and print them out.
tuple2 = (3, 10, 45, 78)
"""

"""
# Question #6
------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a tuple that has 4 tuples in it. Each of the tuples in the
main tuple will have a name and age as it's items.
"""

"""
# Question #7
------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function that takes two sets and returns a new set of identical
elements from the two sets.
set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

Your function will return {30, 40, 50}
N/B: a set is unordered and immutable so your order might be different.
"""

"""
# Question #8
------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function called `calculation` that takes any number integers
values as positional arguments and returns a tuple of the addition
of the values and subtraction of the values.
If only one value is given return a tuple of just that value.
