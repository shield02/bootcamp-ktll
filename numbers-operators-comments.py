"""
This is for a block level comment
Block level means multiple lines
So with this type of comment, I can write a paragraph on multiple lines

It is very common in python to use block level comments for documentation purpose
Usually this is done when writing a function or a class in python
It can also be used to document a whole script
"""
# below we use single quotes for another block level comment
'''
This is another block level comment
But this one is using a single quote
Note that you must be consistent with the type of quotes you are using

# OPERATORS
---------------------------------------------------------------
Operators are simply signs that tells the computer what to do.
There a few categories,
1. Mathematical operators
These are simple the mathematical signs that we use in mathematics
Examples include: 
    '+': for addition
    '-': for subtraction
    '/': for division
    '*': for multiplication
    '%': called modulo. It is used to get the remainder of a division operation
    '//': called integer devision. Used to get only the whole number part of a division operation
    '**': for raising a number to a power

2. Logical operators
These are used for comparisions
Examples include:
    '>': greater than
    '<': less than
    '==': checking for equlity
    '!=': not equal to
"""
print('addition', 2+4) # this is addition
print('subtraction', 4-4) # this is subtraction
print('division', 4/2) # this is division
print('multiplication', 3*2) # this is multiplication
print('modulo division', 6%4) # this will give only the remainder of the division
print('integer division', 6//4) # this will give only the whole number part of the division
print(4%3)
print('raise to a power', 2**3) # this is raising a number to a power

print(2>4) # this is for greater than
print(2<4) # this is for less than
print(2==4) # checking for equality
print(2!=4) # checking not equality

"""
# DATA TYPES
In python data types tells the computer the type of data your are working with.
Primitive Data Types: these are data types that forms the core basics of python
    Example:
        integers - all whole digits both negative and positive
         0-9, 345364, 56, 7, 90
        floats - all decimal digits
         1.2, 3.3, 0.9, 4.1
        strings - all alpha-numerics. These must always be written inside quotes. Could either single or double.
         '#weuy5674', "youi87^%$#we"
        booleans - simply True and False
        None - simply does not exit

Data Structures: these are a way of using the primitives as groups
    Example:
        List
        Tuple
        Set
        Dictionary
