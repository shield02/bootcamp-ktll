# Guide
First, you will need a string variable where you will add the characters 
to be printed on the current line.
If your outer loop uses a variable named i, then your inner loop should 
use range(0, 9). In the inner loop, all you have to do is add the value 
of i to the string variable. You have to cast the integer i to a string 
first with str(i).

After the inner loop finishes, the outer loop prints the string variable 
and then sets it to the empty string '', clear for reuse in the next iteration.
